The AI engineer's work on the Storm Oracle application involved an iterative process of feature implementation, bug fixing, and refinement based on user feedback. Key challenges included: reliably displaying real-time radar data, perfecting UI element placement, implementing smooth animation, and building a robust authentication and payment system. The engineer successfully transitioned from RainViewer to NOAA and then a proxy approach for radar data, eventually integrating PyART for high-quality national and local radar visualization with smooth animation. UI issues like zoom control placement, fullscreen toggling, and scrollable panels were addressed. Authentication, admin access, and Stripe-based payments were fully implemented. The current work involves updating pricing models and free tier features based on the latest user request.

<product_requirements>
The Storm Oracle is a state-of-the-art weather radar monitoring application. It features live radar data (reflectivity, velocity, storm-relative velocity), location tracking, and an interactive map with animation controls (up to 100 frames for free tier, max 5x speed, 30-60 second refresh). A custom ML model predicts tornadoes with touchdown locations and intensity, complemented by an AI chatbot for live text updates. The app is web and mobile-responsive, covering the entire US with national overview and individual station selection (circular radius coverage). The UI requires scrollable control panels, top-right zoom controls, and a bottom-left fullscreen toggle. Radar visual data should be customizable with various color palettes.

The application has a free tier and a paid subscription. Initially, the free tier offered basic radar and AI alerts, while the paid tier included real-time tracking, advanced radar, enhanced AI alerts, chatbot, and detailed predictions. The user later requested an updated pricing model: a one-week free trial for premium features, and an enhanced free tier offering live 2D radar, manual/nearest radar selection, all map controls (max 100 frames, auto-looping at normal speed, max 5x), and location-based AI predictions with visual data access. A login system with email verification, password reset, and a secret admin access method were also required.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture:



-   :
    -   **Importance**: Main FastAPI app.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive modifications for RainViewer, NOAA, then custom proxy radar endpoints. Integrated PyART for radar processing. Added authentication endpoints (register, login, verify email, password reset, admin access). Integrated Stripe payment endpoints (checkout, webhook). Logic for national and station radar data retrieval. Fixed  variable initialization.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: New module for PyART-based radar data processing.
    -   **Changes**: Created to generate radar images for both national composite views and individual station views with circular coverage and smooth animation. Includes colormap fixes and station data handling.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: New module for authentication logic.
    -   **Changes**: Created to define user models, JWT token handling, password hashing, and email verification utilities.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Main React component, global state, routing.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to integrate , handle radar station selection, display AI analysis. Integrated new authentication components (, , , ). Implemented view-based routing for different app states (login, register, home, payment). Removed redundant radar station dropdown, added default national radar loading.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Renders the Leaflet map and radar overlays.
    -   **Changes**: Created  and . Positioned zoom controls top-right, fullscreen button bottom-left. Integrated . Modified to handle national radar and smooth animation via frame interpolation. Fixed  errors, and interactive map station selection event handling (popup buttons).
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Radar controls, settings.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented scrollability, removed fullscreen button (now standalone).
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Renders radar image tiles.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to display national radar images, then individual station images with circular masks. Implemented smooth animation using frame interpolation.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: New component for zoom controls.
    -   **Changes**: Created for flexible positioning.
-   , , :
    -   **Importance**: New components for the payment flow.
    -   **Changes**: Created to handle user interaction with payment plans, and display success/cancellation messages after Stripe checkout.

<pending_tasks>
- Update subscription limits in the backend to reflect the new free tier features, including 2D radar, manual/nearest station selection, all map controls (max 100 frames), and location-based AI predictions.
- Lower premium monthly pricing.
- Implement a one-week free trial for premium features.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on implementing the user's latest suggestions for the application's pricing model and free tier features. The user requested:
1.  **Reduced monthly premium cost.**
2.  **A one-week free trial** for premium access.
3.  **Enhanced Free Tier:**
    *   Live 2D radar data.
    *   Manual radar selection or nearest radar location to the user.
    *   Access to all map controls.
    *   Limited to a maximum of 100 frames for radar animation.
    *   Live radar data looping should start automatically upon app load and continue looping at normal speed (max 5x speed).
    *   AI prediction alerts based on the user's general location, with access to visual data.

The AI engineer's last action was to update the backend () to reflect these new pricing and feature structures for the free and premium tiers, and was in the process of updating the subscription limits () to match these changes.
