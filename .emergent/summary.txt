The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive Storm Oracle weather radar monitoring application. Starting from an initial description, the AI iterated through core features: a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. Key integrations included the National Weather Service API (later replaced by RainViewer for live radar data) and Claude Sonnet via an Emergent LLM key for AI analysis. The development involved an initial scaffold, multiple bug-fixing rounds for MongoDB serialization, tensor dimension mismatches in the ML model, and import errors. A significant portion of the work focused on designing and implementing a state-of-the-art custom ML model for tornado prediction, integrated alongside the LLM. The UI progressively evolved from basic elements to a highly interactive, meteorologist-grade map with advanced controls, animation, customizable color palettes, and full-screen capabilities. The system now features real-time radar data, dual AI analysis (LLM and ML), automated storm monitoring, and a premium subscription model. The last task involved making the control panel scrollable and the map full-screen, with no placeholders for any functions, which was in progress.

<product_requirements>
The Storm Oracle application is a state-of-the-art weather radar monitoring app designed to provide live updates, visual radar data (reflectivity, velocity, storm-relative velocity), and location tracking. A core feature is a custom AI model for predicting tornadoes before formation, including touchdown locations, paths, and intensity, trained on historical storm data. The app also includes an AI chatbot for live text updates. It is a web application, mobile-responsive, with a free tier offering basic radar and AI alerts, and a paid subscription tier for premium features like real-time tracking, advanced radar options, enhanced AI alerts, the AI chatbot, advanced predictions, detailed tornado paths, and historical data. The app should cover the entire United States, allowing users to select specific radar stations or view a zoomed-out national overview with live data. It needs an interactive map, animation controls (50-250 frames, speed control), scrollable control panels, and a full-screen map option. Radar visual data should be customizable with various color palettes representing severity and different data types (MRMS, single site, hi-res reflectivity, etc.).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on implementing the user's latest suggestions to enhance the interactive radar map and control panel. The specific tasks in progress are:
1.  **Making the collapsible controls menu scrollable**: This involves modifying  and potentially related CSS to allow the control panel content to scroll if it exceeds its height, preventing it from taking up too much screen space.
2.  **Adding a full-screen map ability**: This requires implementing a toggle button and corresponding logic in  and , along with CSS adjustments in , to allow the map to expand to fill the entire viewport.
3.  **Ensuring all functions display real data without placeholders**: This is a general task that applies across the application. The AI was specifically enhancing the backend () to provide real radar data without placeholders, especially for the radar visual data, which the user reported as still missing visually on the map despite API calls working.

The last action performed was enhancing the backend to provide real radar data without placeholders and then restarting services to test the enhanced functionality. This implies that the frontend changes for scrollable controls and fullscreen were also likely made, and the system is about to be tested.
